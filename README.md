# Reader-Writer-Problem

The READER-WRITER problem i have written is based on pthreads, mutexes and conditional variables. In this code the readers have priority over writers so all the read statements print once and write statements print all at once.
And in my code the number of reader threads and writer threads are taken from the user and the maximum threads i have given are 100. You can increase them by changing the array size in the main() method.
